# Fetching Data in React Notes

In this module, you’ll learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in a React application. They will learn how to use the fetch API to make requests to a server and how to handle the response. They will also learn how to use useEffect() to fetch data when a component mounts and how to use useState() to store the data in the component’s state.
